Kate Harwood
Lab 4

1. I believe I implemented all aspects of this lab correctly. However there might have been a better way to do it than repeating the code for the .homer class over and over.

2. I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone.

3. I spent about 30 minutes working on this assignment.
