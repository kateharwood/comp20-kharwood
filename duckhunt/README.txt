README for duckhunt Lab 5

1. I believe that I have implemented all aspects of the lab correctly. I did not modify the HTML, CSS or image files, I did not use jQuery, and the images load onto the canvas when the page loads.

2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab.

3. I spent about 30 minutes on this lab.
