Kate Harwood
Comp 20 - Web Programming
Fall 2015

Purpose of this repository:
	1. To upload our assignments so Ming can see them
	2. To track our progress in the course so we have a record of what we’ve accomplished and learned
	3. To teach us how to use git (super helpful!)

Favorite lab/assignment:
	I really liked the first assignment. For the first time, I felt like I was creating something in a class that was directly relevant to the real world. I also like making websites and interfaces look good, so I really enjoyed being able to envision a style and figure out how to make it happen. I would love to do more web design.

How much have I grown?
	I think I am much more comfortable trying to solve a problem on my own using google, rather than automatically asking someone for help (which I did a little too much of in Comp 11 and 15). I have also gotten more confident in my abilities to learn CS and code relative to others, and do not always think I must be the worst coder in the room. I know that everyone has different strengths, and everyone can learn something from everyone.

Most important things learned:
	1. Never trust user input! (Seriously though, it blows my mind now that I’ve learned how easily so many websites can be hacked)
	2. Don’t reinvent the wheel - if I can find someone who has done what I want to do before and put it on the web for public use, it is perfectly acceptable to use their code (this goes for code snippets on Stack Overflow, plugins, etc).

I would like to delve deeper into…
	web design and user interfaces. I get a huge satisfaction out of making something look good on a webpage.
